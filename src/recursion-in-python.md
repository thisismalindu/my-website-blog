### 1. What is Recursion?
Recursion means a function calls itself to solve a smaller piece of the same problem. Instead of solving a big task all at once, you break it down into simpler parts and solve each one in the same way.

Example:
```python
def greet():
    print("Hello")
    greet()  # This repeats forever and never stops
```

To stop it from going on forever, we need a stopping point - called the **base case**.

---

### 2. Why Use Recursion?
You could use loops instead of recursion, and that’s often better. But recursion can be easier to write and understand for some problems.

**Why recursion?**
- Some problems are easier to solve with recursion (like trees or puzzles).
- It can make the code shorter and cleaner.
- It helps break problems into smaller parts.

**But be careful:**
- It uses more memory.
- It can crash if it goes too deep.
- Python doesn’t optimize it like some other languages.

---

### 3. Important Ideas

- **Recursive Case**: The part where the function keeps calling itself.
- **Base Case**: The part where it stops calling itself.

Every time the function calls itself, the problem should get smaller and smaller until it hits the base case.

---

### 4. Basic Structure
```python
def recursive_function(input):
    if input is simple:
        return result  # Base case
    else:
        return recursive_function(smaller_input)  # Recursive case
```

Example:
```python
def countdown(n):
    if n <= 0:
        print("Blastoff!")
    else:
        print(n)
        countdown(n - 1)
```

### 5. Classic Examples

#### 5.1 Factorial
**Recursive:**
```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)
```
**Iterative:**
```python
def factorial_iter(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```

#### 5.2 GCD (Greatest Common Divisor)
**Recursive:**
```python
def gcd(x, y):
    if y == 0:
        return x
    return gcd(y, x % y)
```
**Iterative:**
```python
def gcd_iter(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
    return x
```

#### 5.3 Power
**Recursive:**
```python
def power(x, n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return x * power(x, n - 1)
```
**Iterative:**
```python
def power_iter(x, n):
    result = 1
    for _ in range(n):
        result *= x
    return result
```

##### Fast Power (Efficient Way)
**Recursive:**
```python
def fast_power(x, n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    half = fast_power(x, n // 2)
    return half * half if n % 2 == 0 else x * half * half
```
**Iterative:**
```python
def fast_power_iter(x, n):
    result = 1
    while n > 0:
        if n % 2 == 1:
            result *= x
        x *= x
        n //= 2
    return result
```

---

### 6. Visual Example (Call Stack)
```python
factorial(3)
-> 3 * factorial(2)
       -> 2 * factorial(1)
              -> 1 * factorial(0)
                    -> returns 1
              -> returns 1
       -> returns 2
-> returns 6
```
Each call is paused until the next one finishes.

### 7. Recursion vs Iteration (Quick Comparison)
| Feature        | Recursion                   | Iteration               |
|----------------|------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Code Style     | Shorter, cleaner sometimes   | Longer, more control     |
| Speed          | Slower, uses call stack      | Faster, uses less memory |
| Best For       | Recursive structures         | Repeated simple loops    |

---

### 8. Tail Recursion (Why It Doesn’t Help in Python)

**Tail recursion** is when the function calls itself at the very end - and does nothing after that call.

In some languages, this is optimized to run faster. In Python, it’s **not**.

#### Normal vs Tail Factorial
**Normal:**
```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)
```
**Tail:**
```python
def tail_factorial(n, acc=1):
    if n == 0:
        return acc
    return tail_factorial(n - 1, acc * n)
```

Python treats both the same - both will crash for large `n`.

#### GCD is Already Tail Recursive:
```python
def gcd(x, y):
    if y == 0:
        return x
    return gcd(y, x % y)
```

#### Power with Tail Recursion
```python
def tail_power(x, n, acc=1):
    if n == 0:
        return acc
    return tail_power(x, n - 1, acc * x)
```

**Bottom line:** Just use loops in Python if performance or depth is a problem.

### 9. Real-Life Uses

#### Check Palindrome
**Recursive:**
```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    if len(s) <= 1:
        return True
    if s[0] != s[-1]:
        return False
    return is_palindrome(s[1:-1])
```
**Iterative:**
```python
def is_palindrome_iter(s):
    return s == s[::-1]
```

#### Sum of a List
**Recursive:**
```python
def list_sum(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    return nums[0] + list_sum(nums[1:])
```
**Iterative:**
```python
def list_sum_iter(nums):
    total = 0
    for num in nums:
        total += num
    return total
```

#### Towers of Hanoi
```python
def hanoi(n, source, target, spare):
    if n == 1:
        print(f"Move disk 1 from {source} to {target}")
    else:
        hanoi(n-1, source, spare, target)
        print(f"Move disk {n} from {source} to {target}")
        hanoi(n-1, spare, target, source)
```
(This one is tough to write without recursion.)

### 10. Recursion Tips
- Always stop with a base case.
- Make progress toward that base.
- Test with small inputs.
- Python limits recursion depth.
- Use loops or memoization if needed.

---

### 11. Recursion Limit in Python
```python
import sys
print(sys.getrecursionlimit())
sys.setrecursionlimit(2000)  # Be careful with this
```

---

### 12. Summary
- Recursion = solving a big problem by solving a smaller version of it.
- Needs a base case to stop.
- Good for things like trees, puzzles, and nested structures.
- Loops are faster and safer for most practical problems in Python.
- Tail recursion is a nice theory but doesn’t help in Python.

If you learn to think recursively, you'll be able to break down hard problems into simpler ones. It's not magic - it's just practice!
