## How, What, Why and About

Hey. I'm **Malindu** - studying [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.mrt.ac.lk/) at [University of Moratuwa](http://uom.lk/).

I like **tech**, a bit of **photography** (random photos I take with my **Pixel 8** 📸 are on my [Instagram](https://thisismalindu.com/ig)), **anime** like **Attack on Titan** and **Demon Slayer**, games like **Valorant**, and shows like **Breaking Bad**, **Better Call Saul**, and **Ozark**.  
Most days, I just scroll through *brainrot* and *ig reels* to pass time.

If you want to talk or reach out, 📧 email me at [thisismalindu@gmail.com](mailto:thisismalindu@gmail.com).  
The ultimate test to befriend me is sending an *ig reel* 🐘.  
You can also find my other projects on [GitHub](https://thisismalindu.com/github). Socials are at the bottom.
